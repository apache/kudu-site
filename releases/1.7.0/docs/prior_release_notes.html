<p>Upgrading directly from Kudu 1.5.0 is supported and no special upgrade steps
are required. A rolling upgrade may work, however it has not been tested.
When upgrading Kudu, it is recommended to first shut down all Kudu processes
across the cluster, then upgrade the software on all servers, then restart
the Kudu processes on all servers in the cluster.</p>

<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>Tablet servers' tolerance of disk failures is now enabled by default and has
been extended to handle data directory failures at runtime. In the event of
a disk failure at runtime, any tablets with data on a failed disk will be
shut down and restarted on another tablet server. There is a configurable
tradeoff between a newly added tablet&#8217;s tolerance to disk failures and its
ability to parallelize reads via the experimental
<code>--fs_target_data_dirs_per_tablet</code> flag. Tablets that are spread across fewer
disks are less likely to be affected by a disk failure, at the cost of
reduced parallelism. By default, tablets are striped across all available
disks. Note that the first configured data directory and the WAL directory
cannot currently tolerate disk failures. This will be further improved in
future Kudu releases.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Kudu servers can now adopt new data directories via the new
<code>kudu fs update_dirs</code> tool. The new directory will be used by new tablet
replicas only. Note that removing directories is not yet supported
(see <a href="https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/KUDU-2202">KUDU-2202</a>).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Kudu servers have two new flags to control webui TLS/HTTPS
settings: <code>--webserver_tls_ciphers</code> and <code>--webserver_tls_min_protocol</code>.
These flags allow the advertised TLS ciphers and TLS protocol versions to be
configured. Additionally, the webserver now excludes insecure legacy ciphers
by default
(see <a href="https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/KUDU-2190">KUDU-2190</a>).</p>

<h2 id="_optimizations_and_improvements"><a class="link" href="#_optimizations_and_improvements">Optimizations and improvements</a></h2>
<div class="sectionbody">
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>Kudu servers can now tolerate short interruptions in NTP clock
synchronization. NTP synchronization is still required when any Kudu daemon
starts up. If NTP synchronization is not available, diagnostic information
is now logged to help pinpoint the issue
(see <a href="https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/KUDU-1578">KUDU-1578</a>).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Tablet server startup time has been improved significantly on servers
containing large numbers of blocks.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The log block manager now performs disk data deletion in batches. This
optimization can significantly reduce the time taken to delete data on a tablet.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The usage of sensitive data redaction flag has been slightly changed. By
setting <code>--redact=log</code> flag, redaction will be disabled in the web UI but
retained for server logs. Alternatively, <code>--redact=none</code> can be used to
disable redaction completely.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The Spark DataSource integration now can take advantage of scan locality
for better scan performance, the scan will take place at the closest replica
instead of going to the leader.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Various optimizations were made to reduce the 99th percentile latency of
writes on the tablet server. This can also improve throughput on certain
write workloads, particularly on larger clusters.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Kudu may now be configured to ignore system-wide auth_to_local mappings
configured in /etc/krb5.conf by setting the configuration flag
<code>--use_system_auth_to_local=false</code>
(see <a href="https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/KUDU-2198">KUDU-2198</a>).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The performance of the compaction scheduler has been improved. In
previous versions, certain types of time series workloads were found to
cause compaction scheduling to take tens of seconds. These workloads now
schedule compactions an order of magnitude more efficiently.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The compaction scheduler has been improved to avoid running a compaction
when the benefit of that compaction is extremely small.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Tablet servers now consider the health of all replicas of a tablet before
deciding to evict one. This can improve stability of the Kudu cluster after
experiencing multiple simultaneous daemon failures
(see <a href="https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/KUDU-2048">KUDU-2048</a>).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Several performance improvements have been made to the Kudu master,
particularly in concurrency of clients opening tables. This should improve
performance in highly concurrent workloads.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The on-disk size metric for a tablet now includes all data and metadata.
Previously, it excluded WAL segments and consensus metadata
(see <a href="https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/KUDU-1755">KUDU-1755</a>).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Added verbose mode for the 'kudu cluster ksck' command to enable output
of detailed information on the cluster&#8217;s metadata, even when no errors are
detected.</p>

<h2 id="rn_1.6.0_fixed_issues"><a class="link" href="#rn_1.6.0_fixed_issues">Fixed Issues</a></h2>
<div class="sectionbody">
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>HybridTime timestamp propagation now works in the Java client when using scan
tokens (see <a href="https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/KUDU-1411">KUDU-1411</a>).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Fixed an error message commonly found in tablet server logs indicating that
operations were being read "from the future"
(see <a href="https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/KUDU-1078">KUDU-1078</a>).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Tombstoned tablets no longer report metrics
(see <a href="https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/KUDU-2044">KUDU-2044</a>).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Fixed a bug in the C++ client which could cause tablets to be erroneously
pruned, or skipped, during certain scans, resulting in fewer results than
expected being returned from queries. The bug only affected tables whose range
partition columns are a proper prefix of the primary key
(see <a href="https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/KUDU-2173">KUDU-2173</a>).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Published Kudu Java artifacts are now fully compatible with JRE 7 and JRE 8.
There was previously a bug in the release process which made them compatible
only with JRE 8
(see <a href="https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/KUDU-2188">KUDU-2188</a>).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Fixed a typo in the list of default TLS ciphers used by Kudu servers. As a
result, two additional cipher suites are now available:</p>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>ECDHE-RSA-AES128-SHA256 TLSv1.2 Kx=ECDH Au=RSA Enc=AES(128)  Mac=SHA256</p>

<p>Kudu 1.5 now enables the optional ability to compute, store, and verify
checksums on all pieces of data stored on a server by default. Due to
storage format changes, downgrading to versions 1.3 or earlier is not
supported and will result in an error.</p>

<div class="sectionbody">
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>Tablet servers are now optionally able to tolerate disk failures at
startup. This feature is experimental; by default, Kudu will crash if it
experiences a disk failure. When enabled, tablets with any data on the failed
disk will not be opened and will be replicated as needed. To enable this, set
the <code>--crash_on_eio</code> flag to <code>false</code>. Additionally, there is a configurable
tradeoff between a newly added tablet&#8217;s tolerance to disk failures and its
parallelization of I/O via the <code>--fs_target_data_dirs_per_tablet</code> flag.
Tablets that are spread across fewer disks are less likely to be affected by a
disk failure, at the cost of reduced parallelism. Note that the first
configured data directory and the WAL directory cannot currently tolerate disk
failures, and disk failures during run-time are still fatal.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Kudu server web UIs have a new configuration dashboard (/config) which
provides a high level summary of important security configuration values, such
as whether RPC authentication is required, or web server HTTPS encryption is
enabled. Other types of configuration will be added in future releases.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The <code>kudu</code> command line tool has two new features: <code>kudu tablet change_config
move_replica</code> and <code>kudu local_replica data_size</code>. The 'tablet change_config
move_replica' tool moves a tablet replica from one tablet server to another,
under the condition that the tablet is healthy. An operator can use this tool to
rebalance tablet replicas between tablet servers. The 'local_replica data size'
tool summarizes the space usage of a tablet, breaking it down by type of file,
column, and rowset.</p>
</li>
<li>

<div class="sectionbody">
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>The log block manager now performs disk synchronization in batches.
This optimization can significantly reduce the time taken to copy tablet data
from one server to another; in one case tablet copy time is reduced by 35%.
It also improves the general performance of flushes and compactions.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A new feature referred to as "tombstoned voting" is added to the Raft
consensus subsystem to allow tablet replicas in the <code>TABLET_DATA_TOMBSTONED</code>
state to vote in tablet leader elections. This feature increases Kudu&#8217;s
stability and availability by improving the likelihood that Kudu will be able
to self-heal in more edge-case scenarios, such as when tablet copy operations
fail. See <a href="https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/KUDU-871">KUDU-871</a> for
details.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The tablet on-disk size metric has been made more accurate. Previously, the
metric included only REDO deltas; it now counts all deltas. Additionally, the
metric includes the size of bloomfiles, ad hoc indexes, and the tablet
superblock. WAL segments and consensus metadata are still not counted. The
latter is very small compared to the size of data, but the former may be
significant depending on the workload (this will be resolved in a future
release).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The number of threads used by the Kudu tablet server has been further reduced.
Previously, each follower tablet replica used a dedicated thread to detect
leader tablet replica failures, and each leader replica used one dedicated
thread per follower to send Raft heartbeats to that follower. The work
performed by these dedicated threads has been reassigned to other threads.
Other improvements were made to facilitate better thread sharing by tablets.
For the purpose of capacity planning, expect the Kudu tablet server to create
one thread for every five "cold" (i.e. those not servicing writes) tablets,
and an additional three threads for every "hot" tablet. This will be further
improved upon in future Kudu releases.</p>

<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>The C++ and Java client libraries now support the ability to alter the
storage attributes (e.g. encoding and compression) and default value
of existing columns. Additionally, it is now possible to rename
a column which is part of a table&#8217;s primary key.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The C++ client library now includes an experimental <code>KuduPartitioner</code> API which may
be used to efficiently map rows to their associated partitions and hosts.
This may be used to achieve better locality or distribution of writes
in client applications.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The Java client library now supports enabling fault tolerance on scanners.
Fault tolerant scanners are able to transparently recover from concurrent
server crashes at the cost of some performance overhead. See the Java
API documentation for more details on usage.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The <code>kudu</code> command line tool now includes a new advanced administrative
command <code>kudu remote_replica unsafe_change_config</code>. This command may be used
to force a tablet to perform an unsafe change of its Raft replication
configuration. This can be used to recover from scenarios such as a loss
of a majority of replicas, at the risk of losing edits.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The <code>kudu</code> command line tool now includes the <code>kudu fs check</code> command
which performs various offline consistency checks on the local on-disk
storage of a Kudu Tablet Server or Master. In addition to detecting
various inconsistencies or corruptions, it can also detect and remove
data blocks that are no longer referenced by any tablet but were not
fully removed from disk due to a crash or a bug in prior versions of Kudu.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The <code>kudu</code> command line tool can now be used to list the addresses and
identifiers of the servers in the cluster using either <code>kudu master list</code>
or <code>kudu tserver list</code>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Kudu 1.4 now includes the optional ability to compute, store, and verify
checksums on all pieces of data stored on a server. Prior versions only
performed checksums on certain portions of the stored data. This feature
is not enabled by default since it makes a backward-incompatible change
to the on-disk formats and thus prevent downgrades. Kudu 1.5 will enable
the feature by default.</p>

<div class="sectionbody">
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p><code>kudu cluster ksck</code> now detects and reports new classes of
inconsistencies and issues. In particular, it is better able to
detect cases where a configuration change such as a replica eviction
or addition is pending but is unable to be committed. It also now
properly detects and reports cases where a tablet has no elected
leader.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The default size for Write Ahead Log (WAL) segments has been reduced
from 64MB to 8MB. Additionally, in the case that all replicas of a
tablet are fully up to date and data has been flushed from memory,
servers will now retain only a single WAL segment rather than
two. These changes are expected to reduce the average consumption of
disk space on the configured WAL disk by 16x, as well as improve the
startup speed of tablet servers by reducing the number and size of
WAL segments that need to be re-read.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The default on-disk storage system used by Kudu servers (Log Block Manager)
has been improved to compact its metadata and remove dead containers.
This compaction and garbage collection occurs only at startup. Thus, the
first startup after upgrade is expected to be longer than usual, and
subsequent restarts should be shorter.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The usability of the Kudu web interfaces has been improved,
particularly for the case where a server hosts many tablets or a
table has many partitions. Pages that list tablets now include
a top-level summary of tablet status and show the complete list
under a toggleable section.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The Maintenance Manager has been improved to improve utilization of the
configured maintenance threads. Previously, maintenance work would
only be scheduled a maximum of 4 times per second, but now maintenance
work will be scheduled immediately whenever any configured thread is
available. This can improve the throughput of write-heavy workloads.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The Maintenance Manager will now aggressively schedule flushes of
in-memory data when memory consumption crosses 60% of the configured
process-wide memory limit. The backpressure mechanism which begins
to throttle client writes has been accordingly adjusted to not begin
throttling until reaching 80% of the configured limit. These two
changes together result in improved write throughput, more consistent
latency, and fewer timeouts due to memory exhaustion.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Many performance improvements were made to write performance. Applications
which send large batches of writes to Kudu should see substantially
improved throughput in Kudu 1.4.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Several improvements were made to reduce the memory consumption of
Kudu Tablet Servers which hold large volumes of data. The specific
amount of memory saved varies depending on workload, but the expectation
is that approximately 350MB of excess peak memory usage has been eliminated
per TB of data stored.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The number of threads used by the Kudu Tablet Server has been reduced.
Previously, each tablet used a dedicated thread to append to its WAL.
Those threads now automatically stop running if there is no activity
on a given tablet for a short period of time.</p>

Fixed an issue where re-replication after a failure would proceed
significantly slower than expected. This bug caused many tablets
to be unnecessarily copied multiple times before successfully
being considered re-replicated, resulting in significantly more
network and IO bandwidth usage than expected. Mean time to recovery

fix.</p>

Improved the accuracy of the <code>on_disk_size</code> replica metrics to
include the size consumed by bloom filters, primary key indexes,
and superblock metadata, and delta files. Note that, because the size
metric is now more accurate, the reported values are expected to
increase after upgrading to Kudu 1.4. This does not indicate that
replicas are using more space after the upgrade; rather, it is
now accurately reporting the amount of space that has always been
used.</p>

<ul>
<li>
<p>Kudu 1.3 adds support for strong authentication based on Kerberos. This optional feature
allows users to authenticate themselves using Kerberos tickets, and also provides
mutual authentication of servers using Kerberos credentials stored in keytabs. This
feature is optional, but recommended for deployments requiring security.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Kudu 1.3 adds support for encryption of data on the network using Transport Layer Security
(TLS). Kudu will now use TLS to encrypt all network traffic between clients and servers as
well as any internal traffic among servers, with the exception of traffic determined to
be within a localhost network connection. Encryption is enabled by default whenever it can
be determined that both the client and server support the feature.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Kudu 1.3 adds coarse-grained service-level authorization of access to the cluster.
The operator may set up lists of permitted users who may act as administrators and
as clients of the cluster. Combined with the strong authentication feature described
above, this can enable a secure environment for some use cases. Note that fine-grained
access control (e.g. table-level or column-level) is not yet supported.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Kudu 1.3 adds a background task to tablet servers which removes historical versions of
data which have fallen behind the configured data retention time. This reduces disk space
usage in all workloads, but particularly in those with a higher volume of updates or
upserts.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Kudu now incorporates Google Breakpad, a library which writes crash reports in
the case of a server crash. These reports can be found within the configured log directory,

<li>
<p>Kudu servers will now change the file permissions of data directories and contained
data files based on a new configuration flag <code>--umask</code>. As a result, after upgrading,
permissions on disk may be more restrictive than in previous versions. The new default
configuration improves data security.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Kudu&#8217;s web UI will now redact strings which may include sensitive user data. For example,
the monitoring page which shows in-progress scans no longer includes the scanner predicate
values. The tracing and RPC diagnostics endpoints no longer include contents of RPCs which
may include table data.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>By default, Kudu now reserves 1% of each configured data volume as free space. If a volume
is seen to have less than 1% of disk space free, Kudu will stop writing to that volume
to avoid completely filling up the disk.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The default encoding for numeric columns (int, float, and double) has been changed
to <code>BIT_SHUFFLE</code>. The default encoding for binary and string columns has been
changed to <code>DICT_ENCODING</code>. Dictionary encoding automatically falls back to the old
default (<code>PLAIN</code>) when cardinality is too high to be effectively encoded.</p>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>These new defaults match the default behavior of other storage mechanisms such as
  Apache Parquet and are likely to perform better out of the box.</p>

<li>
<p>Kudu now uses <code>LZ4</code> compression when writing its Write Ahead Log (WAL). This improves
write performance and stability for many use cases.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Kudu now uses <code>LZ4</code> compression when writing delta files. This can improve both
read and write performance as well as save substantial disk usage, especially
for workloads involving a high number of updates or upserts containing compressible
data.</p>

<li>
<p>The Kudu API now supports the ability to express <code>IS NULL</code> and <code>IS NOT NULL</code> predicates

<div class="sectionbody">
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>Kudu clients and servers now redact user data such as cell values
from log messages, Java exception messages, and <code>Status</code> strings.
User metadata such as table names, column names, and partition
bounds are not redacted.</p>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Redaction is enabled by default, but may be disabled by setting the new
<code>log_redact_user_data</code> flag to <code>false</code>.</p>
</div>
</li>
<li>
<p>Kudu&#8217;s ability to provide consistency guarantees has been substantially
improved:</p>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>Replicas now correctly track their "safe timestamp". This timestamp
is the maximum timestamp at which reads are guaranteed to be
repeatable.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A scan created using the <code>SCAN_AT_SNAPSHOT</code> mode will now
either wait for the requested snapshot to be "safe" at the replica
being scanned, or be re-routed to a replica where the requested
snapshot is "safe". This ensures that all such scans are repeatable.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Kudu Tablet Servers now properly retain historical data when a row
with a given primary key is inserted and deleted, followed by the
insertion of a new row with the same key. Previous versions of Kudu
would not retain history in such situations. This allows the server
to return correct results for snapshot scans with a timestamp in the
past, even in the presence of such "reinsertion" scenarios.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The Kudu clients now automatically retain the timestamp of their latest
successful read or write operation. Scans using the <code>READ_AT_SNAPSHOT</code> mode
without a client-provided timestamp automatically assign a timestamp
higher than the timestamp of their most recent write. Writes also propagate
the timestamp, ensuring that sequences of operations with causal dependencies
between them are assigned increasing timestamps. Together, these changes
allow clients to achieve read-your-writes consistency, and also ensure
that snapshot scans performed by other clients return causally-consistent
results.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
</li>
<li>
<p>Kudu servers now automatically limit the number of log files.
The number of log files retained can be configured using the
<code>max_log_files</code> flag. By default, 10 log files will be retained
at each severity level.</p>

<div class="sectionbody">
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>The logging in the Java and C++ clients has been substantially quieted.
Clients no longer log messages in normal operation unless there
is some kind of error.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The C++ client now includes a <code>KuduSession::SetErrorBufferSpace</code>
API which can limit the amount of memory used to buffer
errors from asynchronous operations.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The Java client now fetches tablet locations from the Kudu Master
in batches of 1000, increased from batches of 10 in prior versions.
This can substantially improve the performance of Spark and Impala
queries running against Kudu tables with large numbers of tablets.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Table metadata lock contention in the Kudu Master was substantially
reduced. This improves the performance of tablet location lookups on
large clusters with a high degree of concurrency.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Lock contention in the Kudu Tablet Server during high-concurrency
write workloads was also reduced. This can reduce CPU consumption and
improve performance when a large number of concurrent clients are writing
to a smaller number of a servers.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Lock contention when writing log messages has been substantially reduced.
This source of contention could cause high tail latencies on requests,
and when under high load could contribute to cluster instability
such as election storms and request timeouts.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The <code>BITSHUFFLE</code> column encoding has been optimized to use the <code>AVX2</code>
instruction set present on processors including Intel&#174; Sandy Bridge
and later. Scans on <code>BITSHUFFLE</code>-encoded columns are now up to 30% faster.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The <code>kudu</code> tool now accepts hyphens as an alternative to underscores
when specifying actions. For example, <code>kudu local-replica copy-from-remote</code>
may be used as an alternative to <code>kudu local_replica copy_from_remote</code>.</p>

</li>
<li>
<p><a href="https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/KUDU-1399">KUDU-1399</a>
Implemented an LRU cache for open files, which prevents running out of

</li>
<li>
<p><a href="http://gerrit.cloudera.org:8080/5192">Gerrit #5192</a>
Fixed an issue which caused data corruption and crashes in the case that
a table had a non-composite (single-column) primary key, and that column
was specified to use <code>DICT_ENCODING</code> or <code>BITSHUFFLE</code> encodings. If a
table with an affected schema was written in previous versions of Kudu,
the corruption will not be automatically repaired; users are encouraged
to re-insert such tables after upgrading to Kudu 1.2 or later.</p>

<li>
<p><a href="https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/KUDU-1766">KUDU-1766</a>
Fixed an issue in the Java client where equality predicates which compared

would return incorrect results.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><a href="https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/KUDU-1780">KUDU-1780</a>
Fixed the <code>kudu-client</code> Java artifact to properly shade classes in the

<p>Kudu now publishes JAR files for Spark 2.0 compiled with Scala 2.11 along with the
existing Spark 1.6 JAR compiled with Scala 2.10.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The Java client now allows configuring scanners to read from the closest replica instead of
the known leader replica. The default remains the latter. Use the relevant <code>ReplicaSelection</code>
enum with the scanner&#8217;s builder to change this behavior.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Tablet servers use a new policy for retaining write-ahead log (WAL) segments.
Previously, servers used the 'log_min_segments_to_retain' flag to prioritize
any flushes which were retaining log segments past the configured value (default 2).
This policy caused servers to flush in-memory data more frequently than necessary,
limiting write performance.</p>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The new policy introduces a new flag 'log_target_replay_size_mb' which
  determines the threshold at which write-ahead log retention will prioritize flushes.
  The new flag is considered experimental and users should not need to modify
  its value.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The improved policy has been seen to improve write performance in some use cases

<p>Kudu&#8217;s implementation of the Raft consensus algorithm has been improved to include
a "pre-election" phase. This can improve the stability of tablet leader election
in high-load scenarios, especially if each server hosts a high number of tablets.</p>

<p>The C++ client no longer requires the
<a href="https://gcc.gnu.org/onlinedocs/libstdc++/manual/using_dual_abi.html">old gcc5 ABI</a>.
Which ABI is actually used depends on the compiler configuration. Some new distros

<div class="sectionbody">
<div class="paragraph">
<p>After approximately a year of beta releases, Apache Kudu has reached version 1.0.
This version number signifies that the development team feels that Kudu is stable
enough for usage in production environments.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">

<h3 id="rn_1.0.0_new_features"><a class="link" href="#rn_1.0.0_new_features">New features</a></h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Kudu 1.0.0 delivers a number of new features, bug fixes, and optimizations.</p>
</div>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>Removal of multiversion concurrency control (MVCC) history is now supported.
This is known as tablet history GC. This allows Kudu to reclaim disk space,
where previously Kudu would keep a full history of all changes made to a
given table since the beginning of time. Previously, the only way to reclaim
disk space was to drop a table.</p>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Kudu will still keep historical data, and the amount of history retained is
  controlled by setting the configuration flag <code>--tablet_history_max_age_sec</code>,
  which defaults to 15 minutes (expressed in seconds). The timestamp
  represented by the current time minus <code>tablet_history_max_age_sec</code> is known
  as the ancient history mark (AHM). When a compaction or flush occurs, Kudu
  will remove the history of changes made prior to the ancient history mark.
  This only affects historical data; currently-visible data will not be
  removed. A specialized maintenance manager background task to remove existing
  "cold" historical data that is not in a row affected by the normal compaction
  process will be added in a future release.</p>
</div>
</li>
<li>
<p>Most of Kudu&#8217;s command line tools have been consolidated under a new
top-level <code>kudu</code> tool. This reduces the number of large binaries distributed
with Kudu and also includes much-improved help output.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The Kudu Flume Sink now supports processing events containing Avro-encoded
records, using the new <code>AvroKuduOperationsProducer</code>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Administrative tools including <code>kudu cluster ksck</code> now support running
against multi-master Kudu clusters.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The output of the <code>ksck</code> tool is now colorized and much easier to read.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The C++ client API now supports writing data in <code>AUTO_FLUSH_BACKGROUND</code> mode.
This can provide higher throughput for ingest workloads.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect2">
<h3 id="_optimizations_and_improvements_6"><a class="link" href="#_optimizations_and_improvements_6">Optimizations and improvements</a></h3>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>The performance of comparison predicates on dictionary-encoded columns has
been substantially optimized. Users are encouraged to use dictionary encoding
on any string or binary columns with low cardinality, especially if these
columns will be filtered with predicates.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The Java client is now able to prune partitions from scanners based on the
provided predicates. For example, an equality predicate on a hash-partitioned
column will now only access those tablets that could possibly contain matching
data. This is expected to improve performance for the Spark integration as well
as applications using the Java client API.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The performance of compaction selection in the tablet server has been
substantially improved. This can increase the efficiency of the background
maintenance threads and improve overall throughput of heavy write workloads.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The policy by which the tablet server retains write-ahead log (WAL) files has
been improved so that it takes into account other replicas of the tablet.
This should help mitigate the spurious eviction of tablet replicas on machines
that temporarily lag behind the other replicas.</p>

<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p><a href="http://gerrit.cloudera.org:8080/3737">Gerrit #3737</a> The Java client has been repackaged
under <code>org.apache.kudu</code> instead of <code>org.kududb</code>. Import statements for Kudu classes must
be modified in order to compile against 0.10.0. Wire compatibility is maintained.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><a href="https://gerrit.cloudera.org/#/c/3055/">Gerrit #3055</a> The Java client&#8217;s
synchronous API methods now throw <code>KuduException</code> instead of <code>Exception</code>.
Existing code that catches <code>Exception</code> should still compile, but introspection of an
exception&#8217;s message may be impacted. This change was made to allow thrown exceptions to be
queried more easily using <code>KuduException.getStatus</code> and calling one of <code>Status&#8217;s methods.
For example, an operation that tries to delete a table that doesn&#8217;t exist would return a
`Status</code> that returns true when queried on <code>isNotFound()</code>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The Java client&#8217;s <code>KuduTable.getTabletsLocations</code> set of methods is now
deprecated. Additionally, they now take an exclusive end partition key instead
of an inclusive key. Applications are encouraged to use the scan tokens API
instead of these methods in the future.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The C++ API for specifying split points on range-partitioned tables has been improved
to make it easier for callers to properly manage the ownership of the provided rows.</p>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The <code>TableCreator::split_rows</code> API took a <code>vector&lt;const KuduPartialRow*&gt;</code>, which
  made it very difficult for the calling application to do proper error handling with
  cleanup when setting the fields of the <code>KuduPartialRow</code>. This API has been now been
  deprecated and replaced by a new method <code>TableCreator::add_range_split</code> which allows
  easier use of smart pointers for safe memory management.</p>
</div>
</li>
<li>
<p>The Java client&#8217;s internal buffering has been reworked. Previously, the number of
buffered write operations was constrained on a per-tablet-server basis. Now, the configured
maximum buffer size constrains the total number of buffered operations across all
tablet servers in the cluster. This provides a more consistent bound on the memory
usage of the client regardless of the size of the cluster to which it is writing.</p>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>This change can negatively affect the write performance of Java clients which rely on
  buffered writes. Consider using the <code>setMutationBufferSpace</code> API to increase a
  session&#8217;s maximum buffer size if write performance seems to be degraded after upgrading
  to Kudu 0.10.0.</p>
</div>
</li>
<li>
<p>The "remote bootstrap" process used to copy a tablet replica from one host to
another has been renamed to "Tablet Copy". This resulted in the renaming of
several RPC metrics. Any users previously explicitly fetching or monitoring metrics
related to Remote Bootstrap should update their scripts to reflect the new names.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The SparkSQL datasource for Kudu no longer supports mode <code>Overwrite</code>. Users should
use the new <code>KuduContext.upsertRows</code> method instead. Additionally, inserts using the
datasource are now upserts by default. The older behavior can be restored by setting
the <code>operation</code> parameter to <code>insert</code>.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect2">
<h3 id="rn_0.10.0_new_features"><a class="link" href="#rn_0.10.0_new_features">New features</a></h3>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>Users may now manually manage the partitioning of a range-partitioned table.
When a table is created, the user may specify a set of range partitions that
do not cover the entire available key space. A user may add or drop range
partitions to existing tables.</p>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>This feature can be particularly helpful with time series workloads in which
  new partitions can be created on an hourly or daily basis. Old partitions
  may be efficiently dropped if the application does not need to retain historical
  data past a certain point.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>This feature is considered experimental for the 0.10 release. More details of
  the new feature can be found in the accompanying
  <a href="https://kudu.apache.org/2016/08/23/new-range-partitioning-features.html">blog post</a>.</p>
</div>
</li>
<li>
<p>Support for running Kudu clusters with multiple masters has been stabilized.
Users may start a cluster with three or five masters to provide fault tolerance
despite a failure of one or two masters, respectively.</p>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Note that certain tools (e.g. <code>ksck</code>) are still lacking complete support for
  multiple masters. These deficiencies will be addressed in a following release.</p>
</div>
</li>
<li>
<p>Kudu now supports the ability to reserve a certain amount of free disk space
in each of its configured data directories. If a directory&#8217;s free disk space
drops to less than the configured minimum, Kudu will stop writing to that
directory until space becomes available. If no space is available in any
configured directory, Kudu will abort.</p>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>This feature may be configured using the <code>fs_data_dirs_reserved_bytes</code> and
  <code>fs_wal_dir_reserved_bytes</code> flags.</p>
</div>
</li>
<li>
<p>The Spark integration&#8217;s <code>KuduContext</code> now supports four new methods for writing to
Kudu tables: <code>insertRows</code>, <code>upsertRows</code>, <code>updateRows</code>, and <code>deleteRows</code>. These are
now the preferred way to write to Kudu tables from Spark.</p>

<ul>
<li>
<p><a href="https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/KUDU-1516">KUDU-1516</a> The <code>kudu-ksck</code> tool
has been improved and now detects problems such as when a tablet does not have
a majority of replicas on live tablet servers, or if those replicas aren’t in a
good state. Users who currently depend on the tool to detect inconsistencies may now see
failures when before they wouldn&#8217;t see any.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><a href="https://gerrit.cloudera.org:8080/3477">Gerrit #3477</a> The way operations are buffered in
the Java client has been reworked. Previously, the session&#8217;s buffer size was set per tablet, meaning that a buffer
size of 1,000 for 10 tablets being written to allowed for 10,000 operations to be buffered at the
same time. With this change, all the tablets share one buffer, so users might need to set a
bigger buffer size in order to reach the same level of performance as before.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><a href="https://gerrit.cloudera.org/#/c/3674/">Gerrit #3674</a> Added LESS and GREATER options for
column predicates.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><a href="https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/KUDU-1444">KUDU-1444</a> added support for passing
back basic per-scan metrics (e.g cache hit rate) from the server to the C++ client. See the
<code>KuduScanner::GetResourceMetrics()</code> API for detailed usage. This feature will be supported
in the Java client API in a future release.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><a href="https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/KUDU-1446">KUDU-1446</a> improved the order in
which the tablet server evaluates predicates, so that predicates on smaller columns
are evaluated first. This may improve performance on queries which apply predicates
on multiple columns of different sizes.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><a href="https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/KUDU-1398">KUDU-1398</a> improved the storage
efficiency of Kudu&#8217;s internal primary key indexes. This optimization should decrease space
usage and improve random access performance, particularly for workloads with lengthy

<p><a href="https://gerrit.cloudera.org/#/c/3541/">Gerrit #3541</a> Fixed a problem in the Java client
whereby an RPC could be dropped when a connection to a tablet server or master was forcefully
closed on the server-side while RPCs to that server were in the process of being encoded.
The effect was that the RPC would not be sent, and users of the synchronous API would receive

<p>The default false positive rate for Bloom filters has been changed
from 1% to 0.01%. This will increase the space consumption of Bloom
filters by a factor of two (from approximately 10 bits per row to

a feature unsupported by the currently-running tablet server. Rather than receiving
a cryptic error, the user gets an error message that is easier to interpret.
